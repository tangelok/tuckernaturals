          <h1>Quality Integrated Systems</h1>
          <p>Tucker Naturals has looked to the pharmaceutical industry and is working closely with industry leaders to track, test and improve every aspect of cultivation and processing. We have integrated the best practices from healthcare, pharmacology, manufacturing and research to be able to continually improve our systems. Every aspect of our operation has been validated by independent experts and third party laboratories to ensure that we exceed all present and future standards. Every product we deliver comes with 100% transparency of sources and third party testing. We are able to guarantee this level of quality only by demanding the same rigorous standards from all of our partners and suppliers.</p>
          <p>Quality starts before the seed ever sees soil. Our genetic material is tested before it is allowed in one of our facilities. The soil, water and nutrients are all carefully checked prior to use by independent laboratories.  We will never use or accept any product that has been treated with insecticides or tests positive for heavy metals or other environmental contaminants.</p>
