      <h1>Quality Integrated Systems</h1>
      <p>Tucker Naturals has looked to the pharmaceutical industry and is working closely with industry leaders to track, test and improve every aspect of cultivation and processing. We have integrated the best practices from healthcare, pharmacology, manufacturing and research to be able to continually improve our systems.

      <p>Quality starts before the seed ever sees soil. Our genetic material is tested before it is allowed in one of our facilities. The soil, water and nutrients are all carefully checked prior to use by independent laboratories.  We will never use or accept any product that has been treated with insecticides or tests positive for heavy metals or other environmental contaminants.</p>

      <h1>We Grow Medicine</h1>
      <p>Hemp/Cannabis has over 200 active compounds that have been shown to work with our internal mechanisms to promote and maintain health. 18 countries including the U.S, Canada, Israel, most of Western Europe and Scandinavia now allow the legal use of cannabinoid therapies with more countries allowing access daily. Germany has authorized cannabinoid compounds to be distributed at 20,200 pharmacies. Evidence dating back almost 8,000 years show that hemp and cannabis has been used as a medication, textile and religious offering. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) at its November 2017 meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) concluded that, “ in its pure state, cannabidiol does not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm”.“Not a single death can be attributed to cannabis use worldwide since drug fatality statistics have been kept”</p>
