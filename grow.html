          <p>At Tucker Naturals we grow medicine: in the fields with our partner farms, and in our our state of the art GMP cannabis facilities. Meanwhile growing the fields of medicine and science, both internally and with our partner. Our founding board of directors is comprised of doctors, pharmacists, social workers, and law enforcement, who all came to the same conclusion that phytocannabinoids are the medicine of the past and future.
          <p>We are able to achieve an unmatched quality standard by being involved in every aspect of the farm to patient relationship. By working with pharmacists, chemical engineers, geneticists and leaders in healthcare and agrarian research, we have created exceptional quality, reliability, and repeatability within every aspect of our operation. </p>
          <p>In addition to creating new standard of excellence in cannabinoid therapies, we are committed to the communities we work with. We are dedicated to improving the lives and community health in the areas in which we work.

          <h1>What We Do</h1>
          <p>Tucker Naturals is rapidly becoming a world leader in cannabis and hemp production. We provide consulting services to farmers, as well as processing, extraction, manufacturing, and other go-to-market aspects of the Hemp and Cannabis pharmaceutical industries. We are establishing industry leading GMP compliant processing centers in the U.S and internationally. Our processing and research centers will be primarily focused on producing cannabinoid derived pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals products as well as environmentally friendly hemp for fiber, protein, and oil derivatives. </p>
          <ul>Some of the many benefits for farmers:
            <li>Profits are significantly higher than most broad acre crops</li>
            <li>No pesticides and herbicides are needed</li>
            <li>Improves the soil, with up to 4 tons of root matter per acre every year</li>
            <li>Binds carbon into the soil with environmental benefits</li>
            <li>Grows to full maturity in 120-140 days, it can also be used as a rotation crop</li>
            <li>Enables more than one crop per year in many areas</li>
            <li>Hemp is as easy and simple to grow as the easiest broad acre crop</li>
            <li>Hemp uses about 20% of the water that cotton would need</li>
            <li>Grows well in many different types of soils</li>
            <li>Hemp produces medicine, fiber, hurd, and seed that can be sold into local, national and global markets.</li>

          <h1>Quality Integrated Systems</h1>
          <p>Tucker Naturals has looked to the pharmaceutical industry and is working closely with industry leaders to track, test and improve every aspect of cultivation and processing. We have integrated the best practices from healthcare, pharmacology, manufacturing and research to be able to continually improve our systems. Every aspect of our operation has been validated by independent experts and third party laboratories to ensure that we exceed all present and future standards. Every product we deliver comes with 100% transparency of sources and third party testing. We are able to guarantee this level of quality only by demanding the same rigorous standards from all of our partners and suppliers.</p>
          <p>Quality starts before the seed ever sees soil. Our genetic material is tested before it is allowed in one of our facilities. The soil, water and nutrients are all carefully checked prior to use by independent laboratories.  We will never use or accept any product that has been treated with insecticides or tests positive for heavy metals or other environmental contaminants.</p>

          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>Hemp/Cannabis has over 200 active compounds that have been shown to work with our internal mechanisms to promote and maintain health. 18 countries including the U.S, Canada, Israel, most of Western Europe and Scandinavia now allow the legal use of cannabinoid therapies with more countries allowing access daily. Germany has authorized cannabinoid compounds to be distributed at 20,200 pharmacies with more expected to be added in 2018. Evidence dating back almost 8,000 years show that hemp and cannabis has been used as a medication, textile and religious offering. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) at its November 2017 meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) concluded that, “ in its pure state, cannabidiol does not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm”.“Not a single death can be attributed to cannabis use worldwide since drug fatality statistics have been kept”</p>
          <p>At Tucker Naturals we strive to practice the highest standards of Evidence-based medicine(EBM). This approach to medical practice is intended to optimize good decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-conducted research. Although all medicine is based on science with some degree of empirical support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials can yield strong recommendations. </p>
