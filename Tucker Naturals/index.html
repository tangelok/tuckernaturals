      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>At Tucker Naturals we grow medicine: in the fields with our partner farms, and in our our state of the art GMP cannabis facilities. Meanwhile growing the fields of medicine and science, both internally and with our partner. Our founding board of directors is comprised of doctors, pharmacists, social workers, and law enforcement, who all came to the same conclusion that phytocannabinoids are the medicine of the past and future.
      <p>We are able to achieve an unmatched quality standard by being involved in every aspect of the farm to patient relationship. By working with pharmacists, chemical engineers, geneticists and leaders in healthcare and agrarian research, we have created exceptional quality, reliability, and repeatability within every aspect of our operation. </p>
      <p>In addition to creating new standard of excellence in cannabinoid therapies, we are committed to the communities we work with. We are dedicated to improving the lives and community health in the areas in which we work. By improving the environment and local economy we strive to add value to the communities we live, work, and do business in. </p>

      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>Tucker Naturals will provide consulting services to farmers, as well as processing, extraction, manufacturing and other go-to-market aspects of the Hemp program in South Carolina. We will accomplish this by partnering with license holders to absorb the business related issues so the farmers can focus on farming. We will establish an industry leading GMP focused processing center in the Godley Morris Commerce Center in Lake City, SC. The processing center will process hemp for both fiber and oil derivatives but will be primarily focused on producing CBD derivatives. </p>

      <h1>Quality Integrated Systems</h1>
      <p>Tucker Naturals has looked to the pharmaceutical industry and is working closely with industry leaders to track, test and improve every aspect of cultivation and processing. We have integrated the best practices from healthcare, pharmacology, manufacturing and research to be able to continually improve our systems. Every aspect of our operation has been validated by independent experts and third party laboratories to ensure that we exceed all present and future standards. Every product we deliver comes with 100% transparency of sources and third party testing. We are able to guarantee this level of quality only by demanding the same rigorous standards from all of our partners and suppliers.</p>
      <p>Quality starts before the seed ever sees soil. Our genetic material is tested before it is allowed in one of our facilities. The soil, water and nutrients are all carefully checked prior to use by independent laboratories.  We will never use or accept any product that has been treated with insecticides or tests positive for heavy metals or other environmental contaminants.</p>
